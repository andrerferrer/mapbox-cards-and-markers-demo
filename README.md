This demo was created from [this boilerplate](https://github.com/andrerferrer/geocoder-map#goal).

[You can also check my other demos](https://github.com/andrerferrer/dedemos/blob/master/README.md#ded%C3%A9mos).

## What needs to be done?

Check it in `app/javascript/plugins/init_mapbox.js`.

More details coming soon!

Good Luck and Have Fun
